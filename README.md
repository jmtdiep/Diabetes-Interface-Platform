# Diabetes-Interface-Platform
A visual representation of blood sugar levels, fitness, food consumption, and time relationships.

What better to see progress and stability in BSL in a visual graph.


Ideas:
-24 hour graph dot connectors
-BSL with lower and upper limits
-Message pop-up with suggestions depending on BSL levels
-Possible fasting time frames (testing WIP)
-Option to input in fitness workout for the relevant day


-Keep it simple and clean
-Add ons will be done later stage
